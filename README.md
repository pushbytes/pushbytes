# Hi 👋 My name is PushBytes

I've been learning to program since I was about 8 years old, since I always had a lot of free time and access to the Internet I learned stuff completely by myself by just reading documentation, searching around and a lot of communities</br>

- 🌍  I live in Australia
- ✨  I like making new friends
- 💻  I work with both Low and High level programming
- 🥇  I love competitive work
- 🦯  I have a little bit of knowledge in Game Hacking, Anti-Cheat Development, and more

### Skills
### C++
Previous Knowledge:
I know how to do game hacking (memory modifications, debugging, anti-cheat bypassing (learning) and more)</br>
I don't usually do kernel development (against messing with drivers lol)</br>


### NodeJS
Previous Knowledge:
I created my own website with this being the backend.</br>
I usually use this with Astro and Express as they help with development.</br>
Other projects that used this have been deleted as GitHub deleted my account.</br>


### Luau
Previous Knowledge:
I created user interfaces on ROBLOX with Luau and created a few plugins (based off of other plugins)</br>
Other projects that used this have been deleted as GitHub deleted my account.</br>
